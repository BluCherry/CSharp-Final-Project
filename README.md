# CSharp-Final-Project
The purpose of this project is to create a program similar to multimedia players such as iTunes, Spotify, etc.  The program will not necessarily play audio or video, but rather help the user manage a library of related content.  The content can be based on real media or entirely fictional.  There must be enough content in the dataset to make viable queries.
